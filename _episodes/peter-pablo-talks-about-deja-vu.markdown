What's gotten into you? Have you been eating cheese? She's not 'that Mexican', Mom. She's my Mexican. And she's Colombian or something. I don't criticize you!

You are a worse psychiatrist than you are a son-in-law and you will never get work as an actor because you have no talent. I'm afraid I'm with Michael on this one. The guy runs a prison, he can have any piece of ass he wants.
